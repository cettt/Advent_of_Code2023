# Summary

Advent of Code is annual event which consists of daily programming puzzles.
The event is hosted by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and takes place between December 1st and December 25th.

I solved all puzzles using R (version 4.3.1.) Most of the solutions only require base packages.
For Day 08 I borrowed the function `Lcm` from the `pracma` package.

I try to go for fast and short solutions which means that the resulting 
code is not always as easy to read as it could be.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
library(tidyverse)

print(readRDS("Output/AoC2023_results.RDS"))
```
